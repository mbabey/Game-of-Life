# Game of Life
A Java implementation of Conway's Game of Life, made by Maxwell Babey.

In this version of Life, there are four types of organisms:
* Plants (green),
* Herbivores (yellow),
* Omnivores (blue), and
* Carnivores (red).

This project was completed as part of a course on object-oriented programming. As such, during its creation, particular adherence was made to OOP methodologies and styles.
